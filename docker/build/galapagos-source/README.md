This is where our tortoise lives!

NetLogo Web (formerly known as "Tortoise") is a JavaScript-based version of NetLogo that runs entirely in the client's browser.  This repository is for the [Play](https://www.playframework.com/) application that serves up NetLogo Web pages.

Related is Teletortoise, which allows you to use your browser to interact with an instance of classic NetLogo that is running on a server.  You can check out Teletortoise [here](https://github.com/NetLogo/Teletortoise).

For more information about the NetLogo Web project in general, see [here](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/NetLogo-Web).
